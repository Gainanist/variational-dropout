### Variational Dropout Sparsifies Deep Neural Networks
#### Molchanov et al. (2017)

Implementation for TensorFlow, based on the Theano/Lasagne version by the authors [here](https://github.com/ars-ashuha/variational-dropout-sparsifies-dnn). 
You can read the original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05369.pdf).    

#### Requirements
- TensorFlow 1.1
- Python 2.7
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras

This repo contains fully connected and convolutional layers with variational dropout.

Currently runs a simple CNN on MNIST, CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100.
