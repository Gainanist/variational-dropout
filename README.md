### TensorFlow implementation of the method from Variational Dropout Sparsifies Deep Neural Networks, Molchanov et al. (2017)

Based on the Theano/Lasagne implementation by the authors at https://github.com/ars-ashuha/variational-dropout-sparsifies-dnn.    

#### Requirements
TensorFlow 1.1
Python 2.7
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Keras

This is a work in progress.     

Currently runs a simple CNN on MNIST, getting a test set accuracy of 98.6%.
